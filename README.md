Waikato LiDAR (1 m DEM, 2024) — Terrain Analytics Prototype for Co-Lab
# Waikato LiDAR Terrain Analysis for Co-Lab NZ

## Overview

This repository demonstrates advanced geospatial terrain analytics using Waikato region LiDAR DEM data, tailored to asset management and spatial reporting for Co-Lab NZ. It covers data cleaning, terrain metric extraction, visualization, and business intelligence exports.

## Project Workflow

1. **Setup & Dependencies**
   - Installs required geospatial Python libraries using pip.
2. **Data Loading**
   - Loads single or multiple DEM raster tiles; mosaics if many tiles.
3. **Preprocessing & AOI Selection**
   - Converts 'nodata' areas to NaN, clips DEM to a chosen Area Of Interest (AOI) for focused analytics.
4. **Terrain Analysis**
   - Calculates slope, hillshade, roughness, and curvature rasters.
   - Plots each product and exports results for reuse.
5. **Summary Statistics**
   - Generates hypsometric curves, slope class breakdowns, area by elevation bands, and block/grid summaries for mapping and dashboard integration.
   - QA tables per tile document coverage and elevation statistics.
6. **Aspect & Direction**
   - Computes and visualizes aspect maps and rose diagrams.
7. **Contours & Export**
   - Extracts and saves elevation contours as GeoJSON for GIS and mapping.
   - Converts output rasters to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) for scalable deployment and BI tools.
8. **Business Intelligence Export**
   - Saves per-grid elevation and slope statistics CSVs ready for import/analysis in Power BI or Tableau.
9. **Visualization**
   - All core plots exported as PNG for dashboarding and reporting.

## How to Use

- Place your DEM `.tif` files in the notebook’s target data directory.
- Run the notebook sequentially; outputs will be written to the `ELiDARDemo` folder.
- Key CSVs and images can be imported into a Power BI dashboard to enable spatial reporting and interactive analytics.
- Add descriptive comments from the notebook as cell explanations to aid reviewers.

## Advanced Extensions

- Integrate watershed delineation, terrain classification, or predictive spatial risk modelling to further showcase expert data science skills.
- Deploy results in business intelligence dashboards to communicate findings.

## Deliverables

- Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) fully commented, clean and reproducible
- Result CSVs and PNGs (for Power BI/Tableau)
- README file (this)
- Optionally: Power BI dashboard or PDF export

## Next Steps

- Create Power BI dashboard using the exported CSVs and figures.
- Review, polish, and publish GitHub repo ensuring all code runs cleanly and results are present.
- Share GitHub link and dashboard preview with the interview panel; be prepared to discuss the technical steps, business relevance, and possible future extensions.
